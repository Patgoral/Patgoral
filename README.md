  As a lifelong tinkerer with a passion for both computers and cycling, I am constantly seeking out new challenges to tackle. My extensive experience in solving complex problems in the cycling world has honed my ability to think critically and find creative solutions. Now, as I shift my focus to the tech world, I am eager to apply these same problem-solving skills to software development. I approach each project, no matter how big or small, with enthusiasm and a commitment to finding the best possible solution. Whether working independently or collaborating with a team, I am always eager to take on the next puzzle and push myself to new heights.

# Projects


## [Friedclay.com](https://github.com/Patgoral/Fried-Clay-Client)

### Mongoose/Express/React/Node 

An adventure race leaderboard app.  This allows users to submit their results, as well as upload a photo and a GPX file.  This creates a live updated leaderboard, where you can click each name and see their results, image, and the GPX track rendered to a map.  This was a huge challenge as far as managing the massive amount of data associated with GPX files.  Most of this was handled on the backend, with multiple parsing functions, and a conversion to encoded polyline before sending to the server.  I published my solution for parsing the data and converting it to encoded polyline as a NodeJs package.  This can be found at: [gpx-to-encoded-polyline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpx-to-encoded-polyline)
